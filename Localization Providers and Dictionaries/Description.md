## Description 

The Localization Providers and Dictionaries section is a place for exchanging localization providers in various languages for the controls in the Telerik UI for WinForms suite. We encourage our clients to share localization providers with the community and collaboratively work on enhancing them.
 
Each submission of a provider receives up to 2000 Telerik points based on the complexity of the localization provider - single control translations or the entire suite.  
 
Thank you for sharing with the community.
