PROJECT DESCRIPTION
In building a furniture inventory system, I needed to create a control which allows the user to import an image (a photo of the item, a fabric swatch, etc.). The project uses business objects (built on CSLA.NET), so I needed it to be data-bindable as well. Most importantly, the project is build using Telerik's WinForms Controls, so it needed to be pretty. I've been tweaking this control for a while and wanted to share it with others.

The result is RadImageBindingPanel, which inherits from RadPanel. In ReadOnly mode, the control looks more or less like a label (transparent background, no border, no control buttons). In editable mode (ReadOnly=false), the control looks more like a TextBox (border, light background, and control buttons). Images can be opened from a file or pasted from the clipboard using icon buttons.

Attached zip file includes screen captures and the code file.

Notes:
Out of the box, this fits into the basic ControlDefault theme. With some tweaking, I'm sure it would fit into any project nicely.
The folder, clipboard, and delete icons are not included with this code due to licensing.
