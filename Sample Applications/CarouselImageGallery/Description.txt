PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This example demonstrates how you can quickly and smoothly browse through local images using RadCarousel for WinForms. The application also showcases some of the performance features of RadCarousel for WinForms.

Once the application is started, a Browse dialog appears (featuring RadDropDownList and RadButton for WinForms), asking the user to input a local folder with images. The images are then loaded in RadCarousel and can be previewed with a single click.

Features of the application:
Load on demand - only the visible images are loaded in the Carousel, regardless of the amount of images stored in the local folder;
Image reflection - RadCarousel handles the reflection of all images for a nice and complete visual appearance of the application;
Thumbnail generation - proportional image thumbnails are created for just the images visible in the carousel - this way the carousel rotates scaled-down images with smaller size, rather than the original high-resolution images;
Zooming - clicking on the focused/center image smoothly expands the image to fit the parent RadForm and loads the image with its original quality;
Form Resize - when the form is resized, the image size is recalculated to fit the new size of the parent form;
Image types supported: JPG, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BNP
