## Description 

With the Medical Demo Sample Application app, we wanted to showcase how the controls in Telerik UI for WinForms can be used in the medical industry, specifically in scheduling and managing doctor appointments. In the Sample App, you can see examples of quite a few controls with the Chart and Schedule components standing out, but also how a WinForms application can be stylished with a fresh and up-to-date look.
