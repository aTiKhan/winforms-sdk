## Description 

Telerik Checkers is an implementation of the standard Checkers game and follows most of its rules. The drag and drop restrictions and customizations are possible thanks to the capabilities of the RadDragDropService. This service allows you to move a specific cell to a specific location, easily change the drag hint and have control over the data of the dragged cell and the target cell. You can tune the drag and drop restrictions by checking/unchecking the checkboxes on the right side of the board. In addition, if you are interested in the style of the board and want to master the formatting events of RadGridView, you will be happy to know that this style is created by handling the <b> ViewCellFormatting </b> event.
