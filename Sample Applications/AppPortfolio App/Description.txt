PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Application Portfolio demonstrates the full capabilities of RadCarousel for WinForms in a very innovative and interactive way. It simulates a portfolio of WinForms applications, each represented by an animated item in RadCarousel, which rotates on a predefined pseudo-3D trajectory.


This project was first showcased on TechEd by the Telerik crew and is now available for general download. 

The applications used in RadCarousel are independent of each other and can be started with a single click. These are:
Telerik Checkers
Sales Dashboard
PhotoGallery 
File Explorer
Telerik UI for WinForms Demo Application
Bug Tracker
Telerik HelpDesk application for WinForms
Bookstore Kiosk Demo - WinForms with WPF flavor
