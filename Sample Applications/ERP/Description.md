## Description 

The application is aimed at providing you with a real-life example of how an ERP application could look and feel, build with C#, and utilize our toolkit.

It includes multiple uses of the all-mighty Grid component, as well as the Map, PDF viewer, and other components. Additionally, you can select one of the various themes (incl. Fluent, Material, etc) from the drop-down menu at the top and get a sense of how your application could look if you utilize them.
