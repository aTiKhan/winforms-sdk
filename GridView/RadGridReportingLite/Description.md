## Description 

#### Telerik.Reporting report generation using RadGridView for WinForms

This article presents an example application, which exports data from the RadGridView into Telerik Reporting using a custom class library called RadGridReportingLite. The report can then be printed or exported in a variety of formats.

You can directly reference it in your project. Keep in mind that you need to have both products installed: RadControls for WinForms and Telerik Reporting. You can find additional information on how to generate and setup a report based on data in RadGridView in the following [KB article](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/winforms/knowledge-base/printing-radgridview-via-telerik-reporting).
