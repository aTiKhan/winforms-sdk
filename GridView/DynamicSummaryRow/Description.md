## Description 

A column group summary allows you to see summary information for a column, such as a sum, average, etc.. Using the RadGridViewDynamicSummary project shows an easy-to-implement RadGridView that allows changing the aggregate function from a context menu. The items in the context menu are also dynamic depending on the column type; enabling or disabling this function only requires one line of code. The grid raises events for when the dynamic summary is added, removed, or changed and can be used as a standard RadGridView when not used to display column group summary information.
