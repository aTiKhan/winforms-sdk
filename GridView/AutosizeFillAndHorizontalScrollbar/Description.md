## Description 

#### Gridview autosizemode Fill with horizontal scrollbar

Gridview automatically auto sizing to fill the entire space with most columns having fixed width and using one of the columns, usually the one that has the largest content to fill the rest of the empty space. Then the most important part is that the same variable width column, would have a minimum width so when the screen resolution is not enough to run the full size grid in will automatically change its behavior and show the horizontal scroll bar. This sample project shows exactly that.
